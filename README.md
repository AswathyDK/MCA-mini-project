With the rapid development of multimedia information, the amount of logo image data on the Internet and social media has shown explosive growth in recent years. The widespread proliferation of counterfeit products has led to a significant increase in fake logos, resulting in substantial financial losses and damage to brand reputation. The “FAKE LOGO DETECTION USING DEEP LARNING” project is focused on detecting fake logo of different brands .By detecting fake logos, customers can trust the authenticity of products, leading to increased customer loyalty and satisfaction. Fake logo detection can help to identify and ensuring that only genuine products reach customers. Deep learning-based fake logo detection can achieve high accuracy rates, even with complex or distorted logos, reducing the risk of false positives or false negatives.
In this project convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture VGG16 that learns to extract robust features from logo images. The proposed approach leverages a large dataset of logo images, including both genuine and fake logos, to train the CNN model. We also explore the use of transfer learning techniques to improve the model's performance and robustness.
The dataset is taken from the Kaggle repository. The dataset contains 14666 sample observations,1 identifier, 2 class variable and 10 features.
The project's outcome has significant implications for brand reputation and customer trust. By detecting fake logos, customers can be assured of the authenticity of products, leading to increased customer loyalty and satisfaction. Furthermore, fake logo detection can help identify and prevent counterfeit products from reaching customers, reducing financial losses and reputational damage.
